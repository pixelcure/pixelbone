# Pixel Bone - Backbone App Portfolio (Still in dev and back burnered)

Currently, I'm trying to build a new portfolio website. Im in the process of creating this Single Page App with Backbone. 
It is still in development, however it is pulling it's data asynchronously and using an API I created based off wordpress, 
to store my content in a CMS like fashion. 
All the data comes to me via JSON, through api.pixelcureinteractive.com.
